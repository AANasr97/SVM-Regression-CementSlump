# Support Vector Machines (SVM) - Regression Project

Welcome to the SVM Regression Project! In this project, we aim to build a regression model to predict the 28-day compressive strength of concrete based on various cement properties and slump test metrics. The project involves exploring the dataset, splitting it into training and testing sets, implementing Support Vector Machines (SVM) regression, and fine-tuning the model for better accuracy. This README provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and key components.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Dataset Description:
   - Explore the concrete slump test dataset, which includes input variables like cement, slag, fly ash, water, and more, and the target variable, 28-day compressive strength (Mpa).

2. Data Visualization:
   - Visualize the correlation between different variables using a heatmap to understand their relationships.

3. Train-Test Split:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

4. Support Vector Machines (SVM) Regression:
   - Implement SVM regression to predict the compressive strength based on input features.
   - Experiment with different SVM regression implementations, including SVR, NuSVR, and LinearSVR.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning:
   - Fine-tune the SVM regression model by exploring hyperparameters such as "C" (regularization parameter), "kernel" (kernel function), "gamma," "degree," and "epsilon."
   - Use Grid Search to find the best combination of hyperparameters that maximize prediction accuracy.

6. Model Evaluation:
   - Assess the performance of the SVM regression model using evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - Compare the results of the base model and the tuned model to measure the improvement achieved.
